/// One strong advantage to this technique is that you don't need any special privileges.
/// Any user on most UNIX boxes is free to use this call.
/// Another advantage is speed.
/// While making a separate connect() call for every targeted port in a linear fashion would take ages over a slow connection,

/// This technique is often referred to as "half-open" scanning, because you don't open a full TCP connection.
/// You send a SYN packet, as if you are going to open a real connection and wait for a response.
/// A SYN|ACK indicates the port is listening.
/// A RST is indicative of a non-listener.
/// If a SYN|ACK is received, you immediately send a RST to tear down the connection (actually the kernel does this for us).
/// The primary advantage to this scanning technique is that fewer sites will log it.
/// Unfortunately you need root privileges to build these custom SYN packets.
/// SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reason.
/// It can be performed quickly,
/// scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls.

/// Instead, a clever side-channel attack allows for the scan to be bounced off a dumb "zombie host".
